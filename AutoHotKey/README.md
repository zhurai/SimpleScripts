# AutoHotKey Scripts

- **minecraft.ahk** - Script to implement hotkeys to automate auto grow using mods that let you crouch to grow crops in Modded Minecraft
- **mousewithoutborders.ahk** - Script to control [MouseWithoutBorders](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35460). *(archived, as I use StarDock's Multiplicity instead now)*

## Vysor Scripts
These [Vysor](https://www.vysor.io/) scripts were created in the earlier days of "Phone Screen to Desktop" screen mirroring (Before Microsoft released "Your Phone"). These can be loosely used in [Scrcrpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy), though when I last tested, they did not have a Control Interface, so you would need to implement more steps as you could not use Windows Controls to click. *(All of these are archived)*
