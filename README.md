# misc-scripts
A collection of miscellaneous scripts that I have written, most of them to automate a specific task. This repository is seperated into different Folders

## /AutoIt/
AutoIt scripts not associated with my computer startup routines (where you would find in my [StartupScripts repository](https://github.com/zhurai/StartupScripts))

## /DiscordCarlbot/
These scripts are used with the Discord Bot called "[Carl Bot](https://carl.gg/)"

## /Greasemonkey/ 
These are Javascript scripts for GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey. You would need to copy these into your browser as a userscript.

## /NoCode/
These are snippets on IFTTT/Zapier ("No Code" Automation vendors) that I have created to automate certain tasks.

## /Powershell/
Assorted Powershell scripts

## /Python/
