# SimpleScripts
These are snippets and code created for my personal use, but are not associated with a larger project to be added into it's own repository.  
Many of these are code I have created to automate my specific computer setup, so a majority of this repository could and should be treated as a sort of dotfile repository.

/AutoItScripts/
Personal AutoIt Scripts that are not associated with computer startup.

/CarlbotScripts/
These "scripts" are used in zhurai's Discord within Carl Bot (carl.gg) considering Carlbot's code formatting on its dashboard. 

/GreaseMonkeyScripts/ 
These are scripts I use for various usecases in GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey on my browsers (in the past or currently).
You would copy and paste these into your greasemonkey/tampermonkey script area to use these scripts.

/NoCode/
These are snippets on IFTTT/Zapier ("No Code" Automation vendors) that I have created to automate certain tasks.

/PythonScripts/
Assorted scripts in python that are not associated with a bigger project, usually to automate something. May or may not be used in a scheduled task/cronjob.
