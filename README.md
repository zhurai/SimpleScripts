/AutoHotkeyScripts/
Personal AHK Scripts (these scripts are autorun at startup shown in my zhurai/PersonalStartupScripts repository) (previous commits from this are from the defunct zhurai/AutoHotkeyScripts repository)

/CarlbotScripts/
Carlbot Scripts used in zhurai's Discord (previous commits from this are from the defunct zhurai/Discord-Carlbot-Scripts repository)

/GreaseMonkeyScripts/ 
These are just personal scripts I use for various usecases in GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey on my browsers (in the past or currently)
You would open these (.js file) in a text editor and copy paste these into your greasemonkey/tampermonkey script area
